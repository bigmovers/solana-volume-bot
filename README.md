## Features

- **Automatic Distribution**: Everything from keypairs, wallet checks, and SOL retrieval operations are automated. Enjoy a hassle-free experience with our user-friendly prompts.

- **Anti-MEV Features**: Our custom on-chain program allows buying and selling in the SAME transaction, eliminating slippage and preventing MEV. This ensures that your volume transactions are secure and loss-free.
- **Complex On-Chain Programming**: The on-chain program dynamically handles the sales, selling 100% of the token balance at swap time regardless of the purchase amount, ensuring you never lose out.
- **Pre-Launch Calculations**: Integrated functionality to simulate transaction counts and SOL costs to achieve your desired trading volume, saving you from the complex math and hassle.
- **Natural Transaction Patterns**: With variable send amounts and auto-rotating keypairs, your transactions will appear completely natural, avoiding detection and creating a natural volume.
